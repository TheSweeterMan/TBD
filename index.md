Budget Overview


November 7th Progress: 

For the most part everthing is on schedule. All I need to due is finish soldering my PCB board and I will be back on track.

Problem: I need to fix up some of my Soldering and finish soldering the rest of my components.

Budget: I did not have an A/D converter chip for my temperature sensor. So I went for the cheapest and most efficient option and bought a new temperature sensor for $10.
