Problem: I need to fix up some of my Soldering and finish soldering the rest of my components
 
Progress: For the most part everthing is on schedule. All I need to due is finish soldering my PCB board and I will be back on track


Budget: I did not have A/D converter chip for my temperature sensor. So I when for the cheapest and most efficient opsion and bought a new temperature sensor for $10.
